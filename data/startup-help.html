<p>You should see a link/button at the bottom right of the
browser: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color:
#00f">share</span> &mdash; if you don't then you need to show the
Add-on Bar:</p>

<p>Go to <strong>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Add-on bar</strong> to
display the bar
(or <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons">read
more here</a>).</p>

<p>Once you see the button, click it to start sharing your session.
Once you are sharing you have to tell someone else; on the sidebar on
the left click "<strong>share</strong>" and it will give you a link
that you can give to someone else to start sharing your session.</p>
