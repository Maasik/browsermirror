* Inject the mirroring into iframes, not just top frame

* On github.com, when it has a popup with a shadowed out background,
  it doesn't show the dialog properly or kill the shadow.

* Facebook is acting weird, and Google search results are weird.

* I think this (and maybe a weird Facebook thing) is because you can
  change the innerHeight etc. of an element without changing
  el.style.height -- and so it's not visible to us that you've
  overridden something on the element.  But... the activation of the
  overlay works, just not the disabling.

* Remove deleted attributes on mirror.

* When a change has been made to the page that removes CSS, it is
  necessary to do something special; perhaps to specifically remove
  the CSS, or to reload the page entirely.

* Remove Socket.IO, replace with direct Web Sockets, and a simple XHR
  fallback.

* Move the box into a top bar.

* Handle cases when the master computer isn't around.

* Introduce new listeners/mirrors with some chatish message.  Also say
  goodbye.

* Make the addon work.

* BrowserID-based sharing and authentication.

* Track mouse position.

* Record the sessions for replay, with some online management panel
  for that.  Should initiate the recording from the master.

* Mobile browser support.

* Tests (with jstestnet)

* Stop polling the page when there haven't been changes for a while
  (use an event listener to see changes).

* Check page visibility to avoid updates and traffic when no one is
  paying attention.

* Headless master?  Using DOM.js, phantomjs, etc?

* Multi-tab support.

* Extract pieces
  - DOM freeze
  - DOM diff
  - Selection
  - Networking
